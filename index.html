            I am currently a algorithm engineer at HTC VIVE team, where I mainly solve issues about 
            computer vision applications on AR/VR device by machine learning. My job involves visual 
            detection and traincking using deep neural networks, which is suitable for mobile device. 
            Previously, I received  my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from National Tsing 
            Hua University,  and worked with Prof. Chia-Wen Lin. My research focused on computer 
            vision and image  processing using deep learning; B.C. degree in Electrical Engineering 
            from National  Chung Cheng University, and studied intensively into Communications and 
            Networking.

                In this thesis, we propose a pairwise training model for image subjective quality
                assessment. Our architecture is based on Siamese network, which can make our model
                training on paired-comparison data. This architecture lets us solve the problem on
                image retargeting and easily extends to similar tasks. On general subjective quality
                assessment database, our method can also alleviate the difficulty of data collections.
                Experiment shows that our proposed method produces better results compared to
                previous works on the retargeted image case and comparative results in the general
                quality assessment database, even under the limitation of labeling information.

                In this project, I use generative adversarial network (GAN) to eliminate the dark side 
                produced by the non-match aspect ratio contents on display device (like 4:3 to 16:9), 
                which can provide user a better experience when enjoying a visual content with old specification. 
                The idea is combination of two classic problem in image processing, which are image retargeting 
                and image inpainting. My method expand the visual regions by inpaint the boundaries to meet the need 
                about change the aspect ratio of image content. Under my disgned loss (special adversarial/ perceptual 
                / texture loss) and multi-I/O architecture, the produced results show that my network can 
                generate approximate boundaries for the some non-complex situations.

                We propose a resource-constrained CNN-based super-resolution method, which can use for more 
                practical situation, like the embedding chips in high-resolution digital television. To reach 
                the requirement, we need to efficiently training a super-resolution network, which has high 
                performance but also lower parameters. We chose the shallow version of FSRCNN as backbone, and 
                replace the deconvolution up-sample layer as ESPCNâ€™s sub-pixel up-sample layer.
                To further, solve the artifact distortion on the visual result with computer graphic input image, 
                which main problem caused by the low capacity of shallow network. We use divisive normalization 
                after every convolution layers and add total variation loss to objective cost function, which let 
                our network learning more efficiently. All of these mechanisms have significant improvement. Our 
                method get the comparable performance and visual quality under lower parameters.

                For students, fast and correct computing mathematical
                expressions is necessary when studying. We often use
                scientific calculators to help us solving complicated
                mathematical problem. However, typing mathematical
                expressions into calculator costs much time, and sometimes
                results in wrong answers due to errant typing. In this work,
                we propose to compute mathematics expressions
                recognized from images. In specific, we detect the
                expressions in images by extracting feature points.
                Afterwards, we crop out the characters from the detected
                expressions, and classify them as corresponding numbers
                and symbols.
